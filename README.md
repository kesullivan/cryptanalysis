# Cryptanalysis

A friend and I are studying Cryptology so putting this repo together to help solve encrypted messages sent to me and to keep track of protocols we have been over  

I am choosing Go for this repository to learn the language. Also Go will be a nice middle ground between writing code quickly without loosing too much speed for analysis.  

Disclaimer: I have no idea what I am doing so any feedback is welcome
